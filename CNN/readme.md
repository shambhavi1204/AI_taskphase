A CNN is a deep learning algorithm which takes input image in the form of pixcels associated with weights and biases.
It takes inspiration from the function of neurons fround in mammalian brain.
Mechanism of Convolution :
It is used to extract the relevent feature from of the  image and remove the retendencies by passing it through filter. The input image can be seen as a matrix of pixcel values .Depending upon whether image is in grayscale or RGB the image is splitted into channels like in RGB image the image is splitted into three channels in red, blue, green and then passed through the filter.In grayscale image the pixcel values ranges from o to 255 depending upon the intensity where 0 is for black and 255 denotes white.
Let us take one example:
