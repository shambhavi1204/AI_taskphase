Google crome dino game is a free online or offline game which consists of three characters:

Dino

Cactus

Bird

The game works in a way that when the dino encounters a bird it sdould duck and when encounters a cactus it should jump.

Procedure:

Capture the screenshot of the dino game which is then to be concerted in grayscale as image processing is more better and easy to do.

Add a rectangle on the image for cactus so that when these pixcels come close to the dino , it can jump following the logic provided.

A similar rectangle is added for bird but of a light color compared to cactus one, so that when it comes near the dino it can duck.

After this our crome dino game is automated.

Packages such as pyautogui and pillow are requires for image grabing and automating jump and duck function.
While automating it is kept in mind that the dino is not moving rather than the birds and cactus are moving towards it.
